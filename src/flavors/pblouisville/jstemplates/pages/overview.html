<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the first time in Louisville Metro, community members &ndash; like you &ndash; will directly decide how to spend $150,000 of the public budget in Metro Council Districts 6 and 8.</p>
<p>Participatory Budgeting is a decision-making process where people like you can decide how to spend part of a public budget. This new process is led by Metro Council members David James and Brandon Coan. They are working with the Center for Health Equity, an office of Louisville Metro Government’s Department of Public Health and Wellness, to help residents decide how to spend $75,000 of the city&rsquo;s funds.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://louisvilleky.gov/government/center-health-equity/our-money-our-voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Our Money Our Voice</a>' civic innovation initiative provides an opportunity for residents to come together and contribute ideas that improve the health and mental wellness of their communities.</p>

<p>Both districts will have the opportunity to spend $50,000 from their Council member&rsquo;s budget which must be allocated for physical projects, meaning projects that can be &ldquo;built.&rdquo; This can include park benches, roadways, signs, murals, neighborhood repairs, and more.</p>

<p>Each district will be able to vote on how to spend an additional $25,000 for these kinds of physical projects or other ideas you may have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About Idea Collection</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="/static/css/images/Idea-Handbill.jpg"></p>

<p>Idea collection is the phase where residents brainstorm and identify issues in their neighborhood that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>Residents are encouraged to share and submit their ideas to help us better understand their needs and priorities in their neighborhoods. </p>

<p>As a resident of your neighborhood, we believe that you understand, better than anyone, what kinds of resources your community needs to have a healthy and rewarding experience where you live.</p>

<h4>Your voice and your ideas matter. </h4>
<p>Through the Our Money Our Voice initiative, <strong>residents will have the opportunity to directly decide how to spend their tax dollars</strong> on ideas that residents have contributed for community improvement projects.</p>

<p>These ideas will be vetted and developed into ballot proposals, and then residents will get an opportunity to vote on the ideas they believe will provide the best benefit to the community. </p>

<p>Ideas will be collected until October 21 and assessed for feasibility, equity, and cost by resident volunteers from November-January. In March, residents will vote and the top ideas will be funded until the full $75,000 (per district) has been spent.</p>

<p>The top ranked ideas will receive funding until the $75,000 runs out and be implemented in next year&rsquo;s city budget. &nbsp;</p>
