<h1>About Idea Collection</h1>

<p>For the first time in Louisville Metro, community members – like you – will
  directly decide how to spend $150,000 of the public budget in Metro Council
  Districts 6 and 8. Ideas will be collected until October 21 and assessed for
  feasibility, equity, and cost by resident volunteers from November-January.
  In March, residents will vote and the top ideas will be funded until the full
  $75,000 (per district) has been spent.</p>

<p>As a resident of your neighborhood, you know your community best. Submit
  ideas that improve your community’s health and mental wellness. Each district
  will spend $50,000 from their Councilmember’s budget which must be allocated
  for physical projects, meaning they must be “built.” This can include park
  benches, roadways, signs, murals, neighborhood repairs, and more. The
  additional $25,000 can be used for these kinds of physical projects or other
  ideas you may have.</p>
